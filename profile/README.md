# R & Julia belong in production

Revolutionize how you deploy, auto-scale, and schedule R and Julia applications and tasks.

## Want to give it a shot? 

Email `contact@ricochet.rs` to be one of the first to try it. We're looking for early feedback! 

## Deploy Anything

Shiny, Ambiorix, Plumber, or any long-running service—if it speaks HTTP, it runs on ricochet. 

## Schedule and Invoke Tasks 

Deploy R and Julia scripts or Quarto documents. Run them on a schedule or invoke them on demand using the REST API or client SDK.

## Serverless R 

Turn your R functions into autoscaling and production-ready APIs using our severless runtime

## Elastic Scaling

Deploy once and scale automatically based on demand.

## Persistent Storage

Each app, API, or task has access to persistent storage. Data written there is preserved across versions—no extra setup required.
