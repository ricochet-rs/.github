# Put R & Julia in production

Revolutionize how you deploy, auto-scale, and schedule R and Julia applications and tasks. Email `contact@ricochet.rs` to be one of the first to try it. We're looking for early feedback! 

-----

Deploy anything `{shiny}`, `{ambiorix}`, `{plumber}`,  even `{plumber2}`, or any long-running service—if it speaks HTTP, it runs on ricochet. Deploy once and **scale automatically** based on demand. 


Create tasks by from R and Julia scripts or Quarto documents. Run them on a **schedule** or **invoke** them on demand using the REST API or client SDK.

Or use ricochet's **serverless R** runtime to turn your R functions into autoscaling and production-ready APIs.

Each app, API, or task has access to **persistent storage**. Data written there is preserved across versions—no extra setup required.
